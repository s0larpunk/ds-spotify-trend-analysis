# Predictability of Music Trends in Time

This project aims to analyze the correlation of a singer's songs with important parameters over decades using the Python programming language and the pandas library. The main goal is to understand the development of music taste in society, the predictability of popular music, and the musical features that make a hit.

## Data

The data used in this project is the [Spotify Hit Predictor Dataset (1960-2019)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theoverman/the-spotify-hit-predictor-dataset/data) which includes over 40,000+ tracks labeled hit or flop, with their features such as danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness and others.
